<p>This project is a pixel art action platformer originally developed in just 7 days for a Game Jam.</p>

<p>The version available on <a href="https://maxtigames.itch.io/samurai-gaiden" target="_blank">Itch.io</a> is the exact build submitted for the jam, created under tight deadlines with a strong focus on delivering a fun and responsive gameplay experience.</p>

<p>After the jam, with more time and experience, I fully refactored the entire codebase to improve readability, structure, and maintainability. The current version of the project showcases clean and accessible code, making it easier to understand and extend.</p>

<p>This project stands as a great example of rapid prototyping, creative problem-solving, and the importance of refactoring after a fast-paced development cycle.</p>
